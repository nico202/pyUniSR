Python class to access studenti.unisr.it (Univerity Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milano)

##Why

I always need to interact to the website, that is sometimes slow, and always dumb. Always loose time looking for what I need. Also, they don't want to send email for the content published on the "Bacheca", so one should check every time (how often, then?) for new messages.

This class alleviates the pain.

I provide also some example script that show how simple is the use of the class.

Read the exaples. :)

##TODO:

-	Find someone that will maintain this next year on
-	Add features (I'll add them when I'll need them, or if someone asks)
-	Setuptools?
